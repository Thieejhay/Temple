                <span className='lg:text-base text-sm opacity-70'>At Temple School, we believe in educating the whole child. Thus, we have built a rich array of curricular and cocurricular programmes that blend well to provide the holistic education we pride ourselves for. These generate many joyful memories in school, which parents and carers would naturally wish to preserve through photos and videos. While this seems a very agreeable practice, we are very mindful of our duty of care towards all our children. We take our commitment to safeguarding very seriously and this covers the area of photographic and video images.</span>
                <span className='lg:text-base text-sm opacity-70'>Parents, carers and relatives who take photographs at school productions, sports days, or any of our other programmes must be mindful to keep such for the enjoyment of individual families only. They may not be published in any form of print or on the internet, (including social networking sites), shared with others outside the family unit, or used in any other way that could potentially place a child at risk. We will send out reminders regularly and emphasise this before such programmes. We will also, where practical, keep a record of parents and relatives taking photographs or videos.</span>
                <span className='lg:text-base text-sm opacity-70'>In some extenuating circumstances, a parent or carer may not wish their child to be photographed or videoed. In such instances, we ask that parents contact us to discuss their needs.</span>
                <span className='lg:text-base text-sm opacity-70'>Occasionally, the local press will be invited to take photographs of school events and special achievements. We like to use photographs of our children on our website, in school documents, for parent information meetings, newsletters and on our display screens around the school. If you do not wish photographs of your child to be used for these purposes, then please contact the Principal.</span>
