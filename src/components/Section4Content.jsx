                    <span className='text-sm'>The children in Early Years and Foundation stage are between 1 and 4 years. This is an important stage in every child's life and development. We are aware of this and we have made learning as fun as possible.</span>
                    <span className='text-sm'>Our overall aim is to provide each child with the appropriate work within a stimulating and nurturing environment so that each child has the opportunity and incentive to achieve his/her full potential. Children learn best when their efforts receive positive encouragement and this is an integral part of our classroom practice in our Early Years and Foundation Stage.</span>
                    <span className='text-sm'>Early childhood is the foundation on which children build the rest of their lives. The Early Years and Foundation Stage makes a crucial contribution to children's early development and learning. Starting school is an important step! At Temple we have a carefully planned pre-school induction programme to make the transition from home to school sensitive and appropriate for each child. We provide children with a rich variety of teaching and learning experiences that are appropriate to their needs. Learning takes place in a secure and stimulating environment where first hand learning experiences encourage the development of imagination, creativity and the enjoyment of learning.</span>
                    <span className='text-sm'>What children can do, rather than what they cannot do are the starting points in learning. Play helps young children to learn and develop through doing and talking, which research has shown to be the means by which young children learn to think. Structured play is important as listening, playing, speaking, concentrating, persistence and learning to work and co-operate with others are the main ways through which children learn about themselves and the world around them. During this stage, Early Learning Goals set out what most children are expected to achieve by the end of the Foundation Stage.</span>
